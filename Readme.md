The application consists of several pages: Main (/), Sign In (/login), Favorites (/favorites) (приватная), Room (/offer/:id). Page «Favorites» is available only to authorized users. If the user is not logged in, then when going to these pages, a redirect to the «Sign In» page is performed. If the user is not logged in, then when trying to go to the private page, a redirect to the «Sign In» page (/ login) is performed. In the right corner of the header, the user's avatar (if the user is authorized) or the «Sign In» link (if the user is not authorized) is displayed. Clicking on the user's avatar takes you to the «Favorites» page (/ favorites).
